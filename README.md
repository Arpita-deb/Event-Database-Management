# PrimeTime Event Solutions Database Design

## Introduction:

### Business Problem:

PrimeTime Event Solutions is a mid-sized corporate event management company specializing in organizing internal conferences, product launches, training sessions, and corporate retreats for large enterprises. The company handles multiple events simultaneously, with each event having its own set of tasks, attendees, and specific requirements. To streamline operations and ensure all details are properly tracked, CorpEvent Solutions needs a centralized database to manage all aspects of their events.

### Objectives:

The primary objective of this event management database is to provide an efficient, user-friendly system for organizing, tracking, and managing corporate events for a mid to large-sized company. This database will centralize the management of event details, attendees, venues, and tasks, ensuring that the company can seamlessly plan and execute events while maintaining clear records and accountability.
